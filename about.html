<h3>“In order to be successful in the music industry, you need to be a successful business, in order to be a successful business, you need to have a great product”</h3>

<h3>“There are certainly different types of music for every mood or purpose, it’s about matching it perfectly”</h3>

<p>Being a DJ is not easy because you have to adapt. Since music and the music industry are always changing, the DJ must change as well. Speiser(DJ) has a firm belief of supporting artists by purchasing music and production software legally. There is extensive amount of intentional piracy that is going unchecked and it is causing an unfair imbalance to both artists, and potential customers. This problem will not go away anytime soon, but it can be minimized.</p>

After 3 years of personal determination his symptoms and tics have greatly diminished. Despite his condition he was able to overcome and accomplish more than most would have projected.</p>

<p>He is ultimately a provider, a creator, and an aspiring inventor. Moving you to the music.</p>
