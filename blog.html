            <p>This is my first website that I have ever coded. I am very excited to release it regardless of how perfect it could be. The learning experience of web development and design, truly make me experience awe. I will continue my coding and hopefully will turn into something that I can enjoy fully, and feel accomplished creatively. Coding can lead me into new directions for me as an artist, and creator. Music will always be a strong passion of mine and I do believe I can combine my new found passion for coding, and music.</p>
